1) if desired, uncomment "# define CONSISTENCY_CHECK"

   at line 6 of odes.h to reflect your architecture
2) make
3) time ./denseSG <graph file> <min density> <min nodes>


test graphs are in the "graphs" directory

If you want to experiment with excluding some edges, uncomment 
"#define EXCLUDED_EDGES" in odes.h and define some excluded edges
in denseSG.c
